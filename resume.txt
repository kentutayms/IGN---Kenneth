Brief Bio:

I'm an undergraduate Computer Science student at The University of the Philippines, I needed to work early due to financial problem, that's why im being held back by this "undergrad" status to work on big companies like IGN. This is the opportunity that I've been waiting for when you guys said, "We’re looking for folks from all walks of life.". This is my dream job, the life that I wanted so bad, to be part of the Gaming Industry and an epic company called IGN. I will do everything to prove myself to you guys and become an asset someday to your company if you will give me the chance. I'm also a hardcore gamer, especially with the PS platform. I currently owned a PS3, but I have only 7 games due to lack of budget... :) (RE5,MGS4,FFXIII,GOW3,Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 2,Super Street Fighter 4,Fight Night Champions)
